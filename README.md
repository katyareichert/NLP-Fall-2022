# Natural Language Processing - Fall 2022

A repository of all the assignments I've completed for this course!

This course provided a robust understanding in computational approaches to natural language generation 
and understanding with some background in the underlying linguistic concepts. It covered many topics -- including
information extraction, summarization, machine translation, dialogue systems, and emotional speech -- with a 
focus in methods that can handle understanding and generation for the large amounts of text on the Web or 
in other large corpora.
